#Breast Cancer Detection Using Machine Learning 🩺🔬
This project is a machine learning-based web application for detecting breast cancer using deep learning neural networks. It utilizes Flask for deployment and TensorFlow/Keras for model training on breast cancer datasets.

🚀 Features
✅ Predicts whether a tumor is cancerous or non-cancerous based on input features
✅ Uses Logistic Regression & Deep Learning models for accurate classification
✅ Flask-powered API for real-time predictions
✅ Feature scaling & probability-based thresholding for better accuracy
✅ User-friendly web interface for input and visualization
